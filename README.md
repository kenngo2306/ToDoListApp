# ToDoListApp

Create tables in your database,  one for users, one for to-do list items. 
Think about the fields you want to include on your to-do list. You probably want to have fields to track description, date completed, due date, statusId, priority, etc... Add these fields to your database table.

Create a dynamic web application application to display the to-do list, 
allow the user to change the status, allow the user to change the due date, etc...

The user should also be able to add and delete items in the list

 

Finally, you should have a reports page that displays the completed items.

You are free to add any requirements not specifically stated. 
If you make significant changes to the requirements then make a comment in your code of with your submission.
